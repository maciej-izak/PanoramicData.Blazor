# PanoramicData.Blazor

UI components for Blazor (Demo page due for release on 2020-11-01).

We needed the following Blazor UI components for several projects, including ReportMagic v3.0:

* Block Overlay
* Table
* Pager
* Tree
* Splitter
* File Exploreer
* Context Menu
* Toolbar
* Form
* File Modal

Rather than buying them in, we made our own, Open Sourced them on Github and made them *free* (both speech and beer).

More will follow, as *we* need them.  However, we are much more excited to see:

* what *you* need
* your Pull Requests

Please do contribute!
